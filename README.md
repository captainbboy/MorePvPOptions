# **MorePvpOptions**
This is a Spigot plugin that adds more options to player vs player fights in minecraft. It is designed as an SMP addon. There are many features such as keepInventory only for PvP, consent PvP, etc.

## Features:
* keepInventory - Stop players from losing their items only for PvP deaths.
  * keepItemDurability - Stop player's items from being damaged while in PvP (experimental).
* consent - Only allow PvP when each player agrees to it (each player has to hit the other before they can do damage to each other).
  * trespassing - Allow exceptions to the consent rule by allowing players to set their "base region" and if a player walks into that base region, the base owner no longer has to wait for consent before being allowed to attack.
